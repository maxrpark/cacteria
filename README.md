## This is my first website 1.0.8

 Working with API is one of the most fun things you can do, at least when you are know at coding.  Because it is so much fun to fetch data and populate your website from an external place.

So, naturally after I learned  about APIs, I knew I will eventually want to build my owns. But since at the moment I donâ€™t  know about backend , that was something I was not thinking to achieve in the short term.

But then I discovered  about serveless functions, I how helpful they can be.

So After I took my first Udemy's Serverless Functions course I decided to build this website.
